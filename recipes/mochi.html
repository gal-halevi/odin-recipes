    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Mochi is a bun-shaped Japanese dessert made from sweet glutinous rice
      flour, or mochigome. It has a soft, chewy texture that is somewhat
      elastic. Mochi is often flavored with matcha (or green tea powder), which
      gives it a light green hue.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup sweetened red bean paste</li>
      <li>1 cup glutinous rice flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon green tea powder (matcha)</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup cornstarch, for rolling out the dough</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Wrap red bean paste in aluminum foil and place in the freezer until
        solid, at least 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix glutinous rice flour and green tea powder thoroughly in a
        microwave-safe bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Stir in water, then sugar; mix until smooth.</li>
      <li>
        Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave for 3 minutes 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, remove red bean paste from the freezer and divide into 8
        equal balls. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove rice flour mixture from the microwave. Stir and heat, covered,
        for another 15 to 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dust a work surface with cornstarch. Roll about 2 tablespoons of hot
        rice flour mixture into a ball. Flatten the ball and place one ball of
        frozen red bean paste in the center. Pinch and press the dough around
        the bean paste until completely covered.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle with additional cornstarch and place mochi, seam-side down, in
        a paper muffin liner to prevent sticking.
      </li>
      <li>Repeat Step 6 to make remaining mochi.</li>
    </ol>
