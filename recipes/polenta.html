    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Polenta is a northern Italian dish made of yellow cornmeal. It's soft and
      creamy when it's freshly cooked, with a texture similar to porridge. When
      it cools, it becomes firm enough to be easily sliced with a knife.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
      <li>1 cup polenta</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
      <li>
        Â½ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for garnish
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring water and salt to a boil in a large saucepan; pour polenta slowly
        into boiling water, whisking constantly until there are no lumps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to low and simmer, whisking often, until polenta starts to
        thicken, about 5 minutes. Polenta mixture should still be slightly
        loose. Cover and cook for 30 minutes, whisking every 5 to 6 minutes.
        When polenta is too thick to whisk, stir with a wooden spoon. Polenta is
        done when texture is creamy and the individual grains are tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off heat and gently stir 2 tablespoons butter into polenta until
        butter partially melts; mix 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese into
        polenta until cheese has melted. Cover and let stand for 5 minutes to
        thicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir polenta and transfer to a serving bowl. Top polenta with remaining
        1 tablespoon butter and about 1 tablespoon freshly grated
        Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for garnish.
      </li>
    </ol>
